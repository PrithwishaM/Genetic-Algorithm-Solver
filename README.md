#Genetic algorithm solver

This project is a simple implementation of a Genetic Algorithm Solver designed to solve optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural selection

##Features
-Customizable fitness function
-Random initial population
-Selection, crossover, and mutation operations
-Configurable parameters (population size, mutation rate, etc.)

##How to Use
Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrithwishaM/Genetic-Algorithm-Solver.git
   cd Genetic-Algorithm-Solver.py
